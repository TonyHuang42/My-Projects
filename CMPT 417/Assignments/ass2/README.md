To run the python program, you need a python library NumPy.
Use "pip3 install numpy" if it is not installed.

There are three folders: abcd, acd, and bef, the names of the folders are corresponding to the propertis that the program used.

Go to one of the folders, "A2-qcp-instances" folder stores the qcp files, "output" folder stores cnf files generated by "qcp2cnf.py".

To run the program, use "python3 qcp2cnf.py example.qcp example.cnf", for example "python3 qcp2cnf.py q_10_01.qcp q_10_01.cnf"".
If you want to generate all cnf files, use "python3 qcp2cnf.py all".
